# Editorial Guidelines

This document is intended to serve as a set of guidelines to help make
editorial contributions to this project. Guidelines are not rules, which is to
say that there is no penalty for not following one of the provisions from this
document. Instead, think of this as a set of best practices for deciding which
fortunes to keep, how to organize them, and when to edit a fortune's content.

## Background

Historically, contributions to `fortune-mod` have had a less-than ideal quality
control process, and as such, many of the fortunes that a user may receive from
the program read more like cryptic inside jokes, or at the very worst,
locker-room banter. As a contributor to `fortune-kind` one of major tasks is
defining and applying a somewhat more rigorous moderation and editing process
to the fortune adoption workflow.

## Methodology

For the purposes of this project, we would like you to consider the three
primary tasks required of contributors interested in sorting through the
fortunes from `oldtunes`:

1. moderation: considering the appropriateness of the content 
2. editing: considering the correctness of the content
3. placement: considering where a fortune should go

### Moderation

For the purposes of this project, we encourage contributors to consider a few
key questions when reviewing a fortune:

- Does this fortune make sense? Would the average person, having only the
  information contained in this fortune, be able to understand what its trying
  to say? Fortunes that lack enough context are probably inside jokes and
  should not be adopted into `fortune-kind`
- Does this fortune offer anything to the audience? Does it bring joy, provide
  a new perspective, offer useful advice, or invite contemplation? Answering
  "yes" to any of these questions is a hint that this fortune is of higher
  quality.

#### Tricky Topics

While reviewing fortunes in `oldtunes`, you will probably run into fortunes and
jokes that haven't aged well and don't do either the audience or the speaker
much credit. In these cases, we ask contributors to consider this additional
set of questions:

- Would you share this fortune with a child? 
- A loved one? 
- If the fortune is a joke, and if it applicable, would you in good conscience
  share it with the person it is about?

Answering "no" to any of the question above does not automatically mean that
this fortune should be excluded. Instead, it means that the fortune should
probably be placed in the `off` directory ("off" for "off-color"), but only if
the fortune still has some intrinsic value. If the fortune is an offensive joke
masquerading as a fortune, it probably does not belong in `fortune-kind`.

In short, if the fortune begs for a content warning, it probably belongs in
`off`. If the fortune doesn't pass this project's Code of Conduct, it probably
doesn't belong in the project at all.

### Editing

It can be difficult to determine the so-called "correctness" of a contributed
fortune or the way it is intended to be read or the type of language or words
it should use to convey its meaning. For those purposes, we encourage
contributors to instead focus on a fortune's punctuation, syntax, grammar, and
word choice with respect to the language the fortune is written in.

If you don't know (or can't find a trustworthy reference for) the language a
fortune is written in, it's probably best not to edit it at all.

### Placement

This document has already touched on where fortunes covering tricky topics
should go, but for the sake of organization outside of that scope, we ask
contributors to consider these questions when deciding where a fortune should
go.

- Does this fortune's topic matter belong in the file you found it in?
- Does this fortune not belong anywhere, or does it seem to belong in multiple
  places? If this is the case, it is probably better to leave it where you
  found it or seek confirmation of its placement in your pull request.
- Does this fortune need a content warning? If it does, we ask you to review
  the "Tricky Topics" section of this document.

## Revision Policy

We value the accuracy and appropriateness of each fortune. If you, as a
contributor or user, spot something that appears to be a mistake, please follow
our revision policy:

1. Report the Issue: Submit a issue highlighting the specific fortune in
   question, its current content, and the perceived mistake. You might also
   consider submitting a PR directly, but try to avoid doing so for potentially
   contentious edits.
2. Collaborative Review: Once reported, the fortune will undergo a review by a
   reviewer or group of reviewers. Comments from users and contributors are
   welcome, as long as they remain topical. This helps ensures that the matter
   is assessed from multiple perspectives, as needed.
3. Edit, Move, or Remove: If the reviewer(s) agree that the content is indeed a
   mistake, it will either be edited for clarity and correctness, moved to the
   appropriate place, or removed entirely, depending on the nature of the
   error.
