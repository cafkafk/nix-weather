# Lines starting with a '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repository.
# * @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# The 'docs/*' pattern will match files like
# 'docs/getting-started.md' but not further nested files like
# 'docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md'.
# docs/*  @doc-owner-team

# You can also use email addresses if the user isn't on GitHub.
# *.py admin@example.com

# You can use a '*' at the end of a pattern to match all files
# of a particular type.
# *.* @all-file-types-owner

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# This means if a pull request touches both *.js and *.css files,
# it will only request a review from @js-owner, not @css-owner.
# *.js @js-owner
# *.css @css-owner

# All of it
